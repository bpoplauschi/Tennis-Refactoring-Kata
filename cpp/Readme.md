# Tennis-Refactoring-Kata C++ with Google test

If working with an IDE with google test
support, such as CLion, the google-test gives a better overview
of issues. Downside is that google-test has to be obtained (by
git clone) during the cmake-setup process.

## Using CMake and Visual Studio, under Windows

### Option 1: Generate Visual Studio solution manually

1. Download and install CMake from cmake.org
2. Sample setup (in a Windows console, using Git), and considering
   you are already located in this folder:
   
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"
   ```
3. Open Tennis-Kata.sln in Visual Studio 2022
   Visual Studio should start with the projects in it.
   You will have four executables, each one for a
   specific version of initial source code (1, 2, 3 and 4).
   Tests are already complete, code is ready to refactor!

### Option 2: Open directly in Visual Sudio 2022

1. Start Visual Studio 2022
2. Select `Open a local folder`
3. Select the folder containg this readme.
4. Visual Studio 2022 will generate a project and you can run tests for variant 1, 2, 3 or 4.

## Using CMake and Mingw, under Windows
1. Install MSYS2 according to https://www.msys2.org/#installation
1. Install a compiler toolchain according to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw#_prerequisites
```
pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
```
2. Install CMake in MSYS2 according to https://www.msys2.org/docs/cmake/
```
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake
```
3. Build and run tests
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
cmake --build .
ctest
```
## Using CMake and CLion, under Windows
CLion support CMake and you can open the project according to https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/creating-new-project-from-scratch.html.

## Using cmake under Ubuntu GNU/Linux
Make sure cmake is installed (available as a snap or in the
repositories)
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. 
cmake --build .
ctest
```
If you want to use a specific makefile generator, you can 
specify it with the -G flag, just as in windows.
(cmake --help will give you a list of available generators.)

## Using CLion, under macOS
CLion support CMake and you can open the project according to https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/creating-new-project-from-scratch.html.

## Using CMake, under macOS
1. Install brew.sh
2. Install cmake
   `% brew install cmake`
3. Build and run tests
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles"
cmake --build .
ctest
```
